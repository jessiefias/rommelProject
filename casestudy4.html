  <p class="let">ChristianMingle.com, the largest and fastest-growing online<br> community for Christian singles, is the premier destination for single<br> Christians looking to date and marry within the Christian faith. Initially<br> launched in 2001, the site now has more than 10 million registered<br> members, with more than 3 million members joining in the past year alone.</p>

  <h3 align="center" class="hun"> CHALLENGE </h3>
   <p class="tod">Spark Networks, the company behind Christian Mingle, initially approached us to build a dating app called Spark.<br> The main part was developed by STRV, and thanks to this successful cooperation, we became trusted partner<br>. This allowed us to expand the partnership and participate in the development of well-known apps like Christian Mingle, JDate and Crosspaths. </p>

  <h3 align="center" class="church"> Solution </h3>
   <p align="center" class="cat"> In the first stage of the vast cooperation, we developed the backend and an iOS app for the new project called Spark. After that, we moved our focus to multiple projects and multiple platforms. We built Android apps for Christian Mingle and JDate. For Crosspaths, we oversaw backend as well as the development of iOS and Android apps. Our cooperation with Spark Networks took more than three years, and we couldn't be more happy to be part of it.</p>
