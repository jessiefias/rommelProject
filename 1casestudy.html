   <h3 class="_mons_"> ABOUT </h3>     
    <p align="center" class="uy"> ClassDojo's mission is to give teachers, parents and students the power to transform education from the ground up in every classroom in the world. This communication platform makes it easy to share moments from class in a more open, frequent and positive way— including classroom activities and skills students are building — through photos, videos and messaging. Today, ClassDojo is used in 90% K-8 schools in US, as well as an additional 180 countries.</p>

 <h3 class=".jin" align="center"> Challenge </h3>
  <p align="center" class="tr">ClassDojo was looking to extend its existing team to accelerate development of both its iOS and Android <br> mobile apps. With a growing community of millions, ClassDojo also needed to ensure overall app quality<br> & stability and offer reliable apps that were smoothly synced across all platforms.</p>
